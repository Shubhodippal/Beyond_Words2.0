Beyond Words: Emotion Detection App
Introduction
Beyond Words is a real-time emotion detection application powered by machine learning. It uses a pre-trained model to analyze facial expressions and classify emotions into seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.

Features
Real-time emotion detection from webcam or video file
User-friendly interface with Streamlit
OpenCV for face detection
Keras model for emotion classification
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Streamlit
OpenCV
Keras
Pillow
Numpy

Installation
git clone https://github.com/your_username/beyond-words.git

Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application
streamlit run app_v.py

Usage
Select the desired input source (webcam or video file)
Check the 'run' box to start the emotion detection
The processed video frame with the detected emotion will be displayed in real-time
Model Architecture
The emotion detection model is based on a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following architecture:

Input layer: 
48x48 grayscale image
Conv2D layer with 32 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation
MaxPooling2D layer with pool size 2x2
Conv2D layer with 64 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation
MaxPooling2D layer with pool size 2x2
Conv2D layer with 128 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation
MaxPooling2D layer with pool size 2x2
Flatten layer
Dense layer with 128 units, ReLU activation
Dropout layer with rate 0.5
Dense layer with 7 units (one for each emotion category), softmax activation
